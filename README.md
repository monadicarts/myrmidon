**Forge intelligent decisions with the precision and efficiency of a [Myrmidon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrmidons).**

Myrmidon is a high-performance, flexible, and extensible rule engine crafted in modern C++17. It aims to fuse the declarative power of systems like [CLIPS](https://www.clipsrules.net) with the blazing-fast execution potential inspired by the [LEAP](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3377929.3398147) network architecture. Designed for applications demanding real-time decision-making, complex pattern matching, and dynamic reactions to evolving data.

## ‚ú® Core Philosophy

Myrmidon is built on the belief that expressive rule definition shouldn't come at the cost of performance. We leverage modern C++ features and proven algorithms to create an engine that is both powerful and efficient, ready to serve as the logical core of demanding applications.

## üî• Key Features & Design Goals

*   ‚úÖ **Flexible Fact Representation:** Utilizes C++ templates (`BaseFact<Collection>`) to represent facts using various standard containers (`std::vector`, `std::map`, `std::unordered_set`, pointers) without boilerplate code. Type aliases (`ListFact`, `MapFact`, `SetFact`, `ValueFact`, `RefFact`) provide convenient usage. *(Implemented & Tested)*
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Design for Expressive Pattern Matching:** A CLIPS-inspired `Pattern` and `Constraint` system *is planned*, allowing specific value matching, predicate functions, variable binding, and negation. C++17 `if constexpr` will ensure efficient type dispatch. *(Under Development)*
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Design for Complex Logic via Trees:** Rule conditions (LHS) *will be* represented as trees (`TreeNode`), enabling sophisticated combinations of patterns using AND, OR, and NOT operators. *(Under Development)*
*   üöÄ **Goal: High Performance:** Engineered for near real-time execution, targeting efficient algorithms and data structures.
*   üíé **Modern C++17:** Built entirely using C++17 standards for performance, safety, and maintainability.
*   üß© **Goal: Extensibility:** Designed with modularity in mind, allowing easy addition of new fact types, conditions, and actions.

## üöÄ Current Status (Early Development)

Myrmidon is in the early stages of development.

*   The core **Fact Representation** system (`BaseFact`, type aliases like `ListFact`, `MapFact`, etc.) is implemented and unit-tested.
*   The foundational build system (CMake, Makefile wrapper) and basic usage examples are functional.
*   Design concepts for Patterns, Constraints, and Rules (including the LHS Tree using `TreeNode`) exist, but their full implementation and the core rule execution logic are the next major steps.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   CMake (version 3.15 or higher recommended)
*   A C++17 compliant compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
*   Google Test (for running tests, automatically found by CMake if installed)

### Building and Testing

Myrmidon uses CMake for building and CTest/Google Test for testing. A convenient `Makefile` wrapper is provided in the project root.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/monadicarts/myrmidon.git
    cd myrmidon
    ```

2.  **Build the project:** (This will configure CMake in `./build` and compile)
    ```bash
    make build
    # Or simply: make
    ```

3.  **Run tests:** (Currently tests the Fact system)
    ```bash
    make test
    ```

4.  **Clean the build directory:**
    ```bash
    make clean
    ```

The compiled library (`libRuleEngineCore.a`), example application (`RuleEngineApp`), and test runner (`RuleEngineTests`) will be located in the `build` directory.

## üí° Basic Usage Example (Fact Creation)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "myrmidon/base_fact.hpp"

using namespace Myrmidon;

int main() {
    // Create a fact representing a temperature reading
    ValueFact<double> temp("sensor-A-temp", {25.7});

    std::cout << "Fact Name: " << temp.getName() << std::endl;
    if (!temp.getValues().empty()) {
        std::cout << "Fact Value: " << temp.getValues()[0] << std::endl;
    }

    // --- Rule definition and execution coming soon! ---

    return 0;
}
